# Cl-Cuda

Cl-cuda is a library to use Nvidia CUDA in Common Lisp programs. You can write CUDA kernel functions using the cl-cuda kernel description language which has Common-Lisp-like syntax.

Cl-cuda is in very early stage of development. Any feedbacks are welcome.

## Usage

I will write some usage later. For now, please see the examples directory.

## Installation

I will write about installation later.

## Rquirements

Since cl-cuda now uses some features that depend on SBCL, you will need some modification if you use it on any Common Lisp implementations other than SBCL. I will fix this later.
